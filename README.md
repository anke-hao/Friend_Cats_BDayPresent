# Cat Cooldown (Friend Birthday Present Series)

## Introduction
Welcome to the gamified interactive experience I made for my friend's birthday! In this experience, you engage in a box breathing exercise as guided by the instructions on screen to lull the cats on-screen to sleep. 

## How To Play
### Basic Commands
- Follow the instructions on screen to breathe in, hold, and breathe out. Pace yourself alongside the progress bar!
  
### What to Expect
- The box breathing exercise is as follows:
  - Breathe in for four seconds
  - Hold for four seconds
  - Breathe out for four seconds
- As you go through the box breathing exercise, the cats will gradually slow down (at different rates!) and once each is calm enough, they will settle down and start napping.
- At the end, all the pacing cats in the scene will eventually settle down and nap to their hearts' content. You can continue the box breathing exercises if you wish to!

### Level Design
- The purpose of this experience was to hopefully act as an aid to mindfulness and relaxation.
- The orange tabby cat in the center of the scene is one of my cats that my friend especially likes (and is the one who is especially attention-hogging IRL).
  
## Tech Stack
The game was built in Unity2D, with the use of C# scripts for the following:
- managing the cats' movements and alertness stages (CatController)
- displaying a dynamic breath meter/progress bar for the box exercise (BreathMeter)

## Visual and Audio Assets
- All the visual assets, including the playable character and all the environmental assets, were sourced from [Pop Shop Packs's](https://pop-shop-packs.itch.io/) [Cats Pixel Asset Pack](https://pop-shop-packs.itch.io/cats-pixel-asset-pack) and [kayillustrations's](https://kayillustrations.itch.io/) [Pixel Kitty Living Room](https://kayillustrations.itch.io/pixel-living-room-assets), which are licensed for personal and commercial use.
- The background music was sourced from [TallBeard Studios's](https://tallbeard.itch.io/) [Music Loop Bundle](https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle).
  
## Future Additions/Bugfixes
### Additions/Revisions
- A proper start/ending screen with the option to begin or replay the experience.
- More aesthetic implementation of the breathing bar (i.e. better masking)

### Bugfixes
- TBD
